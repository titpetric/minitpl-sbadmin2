# minitpl-sbadmin2

This is a modification of SB Admin 2 theme to be set up as the base template for developing PHP Administration backend projects.
All it does is provide as clean as possible dev environment using PHP, MiniTPL, and some basic templates that display styling.

I removed a bunch of extras, like graphing libraries, to keep size and complexity down.

I like the theme because it has a no-nonsense approach to using Bootstrap 3 default HTML. It doesn't introduce many if at all new classes
and tries to style the components using the available HTML snippets from Bootstrap and Bootsnip (timeline).

You'll have to figure things out for yourself - generally things are simple. Or ... obvious. Or whatever. Ask me things if you have questions.
